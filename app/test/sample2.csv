We are very excited about the WCC Raceteam for 2016 and really look forward to a strong season of training, racing and striving for goals. We have an amazing group of athletes ready to bring their A game for WCC and wear the green with pride!

 

We would like to have our first team gathering so that everyone can meet and share their season goals. I have attached a race selection form for everyone to complete so that we have an idea of who is racing what races and how important each race is. Please complete it and either return it by email to myself or bring it to our gathering so that we can start to build our race support plan!

 

So, when and where will this gathering take place?

 

·         When: Sunday, January 10, 2016

·         Time: 3:30pm

·         Where: Ellis Home @ 642 Salzburg Drive, Waterloo

 

Please reply to let us know if you will or will not be able to attend!

 

Looking forward to an amazing season,

Kelly Ellis
